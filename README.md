Hi everybody.

I've just started to learn new skill, web development. This little project is about making small website about my current job, the nuclear medicine.
I'd like to introduce you this department. The structure, what kinds of examinations we do and what methods we use. I really hope, 
you'll enjoy this web and learn something new.
To me, I hope, it's just beginning of whole long journey through the world of WebDevelopment.

See you soon in my next project and on better websites!!
